# Motivating Scenario

## Description

A CH object has one or multiple contexts that are related to it. A context expresses the historical, socio-cultural situation in which an artwork exists. By definition, its delimitation is fuzzy, as it corresponds to a certain culture. It includes several traits of various natures, such as religion, social practice, taste, style, etc. Humans, and experts in art history, history, and so on, identify sets of salient traits for each context. In doing so, they frame the reality in the sense of Nelson’s theory to abstract such traits. In other words, they create observation frames that isolate from the reality contexts that present unifying traits. In doing so, they create a Historical Frame, which is a portion of the spacetime continuum created to better observe a context that already presents traits of unity. The traits are then collected in Reference Frames, defined according to Minsky’s theory, that work as the domain pre-knowledge which is necessary for relating CH objects to their contexts (e.g., place a Raffaello’s work in the Italian Renaissance). 

An object participates in only one or more cultural frames, corresponding to 1) the context of artwork creation, and 2) further contexts the object traverses. 

### Ephemeral events in context
CH objects can be material, immaterial, in the form of an event (e.g., a theater play), or a physical object that participated in an event (e.g., the chest of St. Servatius that participated in several processions). These events are sometimes the closest context of artworks and are relevant for historians as (textual) sources often describe the use that the artwork had in the ceremony, giving important information about its social meaning and function. At the same time, ephemeral events are part of a bigger cultural context.
