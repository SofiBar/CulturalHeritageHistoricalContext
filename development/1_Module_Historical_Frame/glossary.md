# Glossary

**Historical Frame**:  Historical Frames are sets of traits that are commonly recognized as existing in specific time-space contexts. In this sense, they are an observation and selection of the fuzzy reality of culture, isolating salient traits. Nevertheless, the defined historical frame is not abstract but represents a commonsense unity of traits embedded in spacetime. Other frames, namely, the reference frames, should serve as an abstract description of the knowledge of traits that experts acquire, which serves as pre-knowledge to conduct the observations of CH objects.    
**Time**: the period in which the historical frame is embedded (e.g., 16th Century)   
**Place**: the place in which the historical frame is embedded (e.g., Rome)   
**Event**: events related to CH object (e.g., a procession involving relics) or recognized as having a cultural value themselves, even if they don’t involve objects (e.g., a performance, a dance).    
**CH object**: objects recognized as having cultural relevance, not limited to aesthetic works of art. They can be seen in either their material or immaterial form.    
**Culture**: “spiritual, material, intellectual, and emotional features of a society or social groups” (definition provided by UNESCO)
**Cultural trait**: a specific trait of a culture (e.g., devotion for the Chest of Distress)

**has time**: property relating a historical frame to the period in which the historical frame is embedded (e.g., 16th Century)   
**has space**: property relating a historical frame to the place in which the historical frame is embedded (e.g., Rome)   
**has context**: property relating the CH object, the event in which it is involved, or further N-ary relationships necessary to study the CH object, to the historical frame(s) that they traverse
**overlaps with**: property, which relates two historical frames that have a common spacetime portion
**falls within**: property, which relates a historical frame (e.g., 1962) to a wider one within which it falls (e.g., 1960s).   
**separated from**: property, which indicates that two historical frames have no common spacetime portions  
**refers to culture**: property relating a historical frame to a specific culture it mainly observes
**includes cultural trait**: property relating the historical frame to specific cultural traits observed in the culture
