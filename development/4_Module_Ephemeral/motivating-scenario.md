# Motivating Scenario

The immaterial cultural heritage often involves practices happening in time (e.g., a performance), which would be lost if not recorded, and often includes events of short duration, and ephemeral experiences, such as the inhalation of scents. Furthermore, such events often do not have well-defined times indicating their beginning and their end due to their special nature, and uncertainty is present in their documentation. 
Not only are events considered ephemeral, but also the CH objects that are created for single occasions (e.g., the customs for a parade), which are not intended to last in time.
