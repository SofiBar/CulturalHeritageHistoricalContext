# Glossary

**Object in situation**: A situation in which an object presents special, relevant features that cannot be described as a modification of the object (e.g., the change of its function)  
**Object in event**: a situation in which the object is observed in relation to the event in which it participates  
**Function**: The function that the object has in a belief system, according to Anderson’s model. It can vary according to the culture in which the object is placed or the specific events in which it is used. It includes social (e.g., protection) or practical (e.g., a knife has the practical function of cutting something) functions.   
**Object in unique event**: a situation describing the specific characteristics that it acquires in an event repeating only once  
**Object in recurrent event**: objects observed in situations of events repeated over time, either in regular or irregular intervals, presenting unifying characteristics.  
**Object in recurrent regular event**:  objects observed in situations of events repeated over time at regular time intervals  
**Object in recurrent irregular event**:  objects observed in situations of events repeated over time at irregular time intervals  
**Time period**: the period between the two events regularly occurring over time  
**Event type**: the type of the event (e.g., “procession”)  

**includes object**: property relating a situation to the object participating in it  
**includes object function**: property relating a function to the situation in which the object acquires that function  
**includes event**: property relating a situation to the event in which the object is involved  
has member event**: property relating a collection of events repeating over time to the single events  
**includes events of type**: property relating the event series with the type of event that is included (e.g., mass, procession)  
**has unifying factor**: property indicating the traits that specify the identity of the series of events, as they recur in each of them  
**has time period**: property relating a series of events repeating over time to the recurrent interval at which they occur (e.g., the procession occurs every 7 years)
