# Glossary

* **Conceptual variation**: variation that changes the immaterial component of a CH object, modifying a previous version and creating a new one  
* **Transformation**: physical variation that deeply changes the material component of a CH object, modifying a previous version and creating a new one  
* **Part addition**:  variation that changes the material component of a CH object by adding a new part  
* **Part removal**: variation that changes the material component of a CH object by removing one of its parts  
* **Transition**: a situation describing the transition from one situation to another, used to describe immaterial changes such as a change of function  
* **Object in situation**: situations in which the object is associated with different features, before and after the transition  
* **Function**: functions of the object before and after the transition  
* **Time interval**: the time intervals in which the events of variation and transition occur, and the time intervals in which the previous and subsequent versions of the CH object exist  
* **Object storyline**: a series of events (e.g., the variations) in which the CH object observed is included
