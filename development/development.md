The development was conducted according to the SAMOD method [1]. For each module, a motivating scenario, glossary, relative competency questions (CQs), and a modelet are provided. The test example is the case study of St. Servatius' chest of Distress, brought in celebrations in Maastricht.  
As the ontology is still in a draft format, the real test of the CQs over real data is still missing. 
An image and a Turtle file of the module at the current state, after the alignment to existing ontologies, are provided.
