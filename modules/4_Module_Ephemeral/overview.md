# Ephemeral Module overview

This module describes how some characteristics of ephemeral events can be captured by existing models and annotations, mainly by reusing the class crm:E5 Event and crm:E52 Time-Span combined with representation of time according to the Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF) defined by the Library of Congress.   
Ephemeral events can be generally described as crm:E5_Event instances. The duration of a temporal entity can be expressed through a crm:E52 Time Span class, representing abstract temporal extents. It is noteworthy that E52 Time Span does not express a computable time interval itself, but a description of the time extent of an observed phenomenon. Therefore, when information about the start, end, or duration of an event is present, the Time Ontology and the EDTF Ontology, which specifies the Time Ontology with unknown and uncertain times according to the Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF) Specification created by the Library of Congress. In particular, the qualifiers “?”, “~” and “%” are included in the string indicating a date to mean “uncertain” (e.g., “1540?”), “approximate” (e.g., “1540~”), and “uncertain” or “approximate” (e.g., “1540%”), are particularly useful in the context of the description of uncertainty related to ephemeral events. Furthermore, periods having an unknown beginning or end can be specified through an empty string (e.g., “‘1540/”), and periods having an open start or end are represented with two dots (e.g., “‘1540/..”).   
 The concept of ephemerality is also used to describe objects that are intentionally created to be temporary. For this reason, it is suggested to use type (crm:E55 Type) combined with the available terms for the description of ephemeral provided by the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), which includes descriptors for ephemeral art and architecture.   
Specific types of ephemeral events and experiences, including odors, can be described by reusing the ODEuropa data model.   






## Reused classes

|crm:E52_Time_Span |Abstract temporal extents, having a beginning, an end, and a duration. No semantic connotations are attributed to them. See the full scope note at: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E52_Time-Span

|time:Instant| “A temporal entity with zero extent or duration” |
|od:L12_Smell_Emission |“This class comprises events in which a specific smell has been generated, either by human intervention or because of natural phenomena”  |
|od:L11_Smell |“This class comprises all olfactory stimuli, or smells, considered as unique and un-repeatable, possibly existing in a specific time and place, to not be confused with possible generalisation”|
|od:L13_Olfactory_Experience |“This class comprises activities in which an actor (human or animal) is perceiving a smell”|
