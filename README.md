# Introduction
The The Cultural Heritage Interactions Ontology is intended to describe the interactions between material and immaterial cultural heritage (CH) that occur in time. In other words, it relates a CH object with 1) ideas and values that are relevant in the context(s) in which the object is located (i.e., a belief system) 2) the function(s) that such objects acquire in different contexts, 4) the evolution of these features over time,  and 4) their interaction with contextual ephemeral events and immaterial cultural heritage practices.

This repository documents the ontology, proposed in a draft version, its documentation and development. The ontology is based on Ted Nelson's frame theory [1], enriched with the contributions on spacetime frames of Erwin Panofsky [2] and of the theory of frames of Minsky [3]. The analysis of Cultural Heritage object in context, in relation with the functions that the object acquires in different belief systems, is based on Anderson [4].

# Structure of the repository

The current repository provides the ontology at the current draft status, its documentation, and development: 
* The documentation is available at: https://sofibar.github.io/CulturalHeritageHistoricalContext/ 
* The ontological framework is composed of four different modules, available in [Modules](https://github.com/SofiBar/CulturalHeritageHistoricalContext/tree/main/modules). We suggest to read the single modules for a better understanding of the ontology. 
* The development, conducted following the SAMOD method [5], is illustrated in [Development](https://github.com/SofiBar/CulturalHeritageHistoricalContext/tree/main/development)

**Note**: it was not possible to import the Recurrent Situation and Event ODPs [6, 7] due to their unavailability. For this reason, we imported only the single classes and properties that we reused in the modules. Furthermore, the DOLCE ontology downloadable at its URI is not the last released version. We insert a copy of the used ontology version in the "imported-ontologies" folder for a better review.
